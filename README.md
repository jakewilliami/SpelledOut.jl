## Description
This is a minimal package for a pure Julia implementation of converting numbers in their Arabic form to numbers in their Anglo-Saxan form.  The process of **spelling out** a number has also been referred to as **set full out**, to write out in **long hand**, and &mdash; as a great mind once suggested &mdash; to **transnumerate**.
